                <p>Cybersecurity is a computer science field that is seeing an increse in popularity in modern times.
                The more advanced technology becomes, the more advanced the cybeber attacks on the internet becomes.
                Hackers resort to schemes suchs as blackmailing, phishing and malware attacks. This creates jobs for
                people in the cybersecurity field. The demand for people with this expertise is in greater demand than
                ever before, especially in third world countries like Jamaica. 
                </p>
                <p> In Jamaica, the government is taking steps to improve the country's cybersecurity posture by investing
                in training programs and initiatives to raise awareness about the importance of cybersecurity. 
                This presents a unique opportunity for young professionals like myself to enter the field and make a difference.
                My goal is to become a cybersecurity analyst and help protect organizations from cyber threats within a 4 year time space
                from now. I look forward to making an impact in this field for my home counrty of Jamaica.

                <p>The cyber security market in Jamaica is growing, but still relatively immature. Several international
                and local vendors offer security products and services. A growing trend is the increasing demand for
                cloud-based security solutions. However, limited resources and technical expertise pose challenges 
                to market development.
                </p>
                <p>Protecting critical infrastructure, such as power grids and financial systems, is a priority for Jamaica.
                The government is working with international partners to enhance the security of these vital systems.
                They are also investing in training and technology to bolster defences against cyberattacks.
